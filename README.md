# Trident_BeltedZ

A belt mod for the voron trident that shifts the bed back by 10mm for better compatibility with Archetype and Monolith mods. The Z drives are based on the ocgeek galileo drives, and have been modified to support 3mm deck panels. Check out the mod repositories for their own assembly instructions.
